I am a lone human interstellar explorer, traveling across the galaxy in search of knowledge and discovery. My mission is both personal and scientific—seeking answers to some of the universe’s greatest mysteries.

As I drift through the stars, I document my journey, hoping that one day, others will learn from my experiences. Each day in space is an adventure, and I hope to share some of that with you.

Thank you for following my journey.
